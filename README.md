Guess the Number Game
This is a fun little game built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript where the computer picks a random number between 1 and 100 â€” and your job is to guess it!

After each guess, the game tells you if your number is too high, too low, or correct. It also keeps track of how many attempts you take to win.

Great for beginners learning JavaScript logic and user input handling!
